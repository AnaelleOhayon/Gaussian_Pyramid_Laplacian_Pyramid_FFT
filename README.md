# Gaussian_Pyramid_Laplacian_Pyramid_FFT
Python code for generating Gaussian pyramids and Laplacian pyramids for 5 levels and concatenate the images for displaying the pyramids. 
Currently, there are no available functions for displaying the pyramid images this way in OpenCV (available in MATLAB though). 
May not be most elegant way, but does the job. Can be improved upon easily. 
This code also generates the 2D FFT for the images for spatial frequency analysis
